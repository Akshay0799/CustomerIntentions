# Prediction of Online Customers' Intentions

This repo contains the code for Predicting the Online Intentions of a Shopper visiting a Retail Website. The goal of the project is to predict whether the buyer will make a purchase or not based on their behaviour which include features like "No. of clicks", "Time spent on th website", "Price of the previos purchase" and so on. The goal of the project is to train Models that would make predictions using Semisupevised Machine Learning, meaning the models would be trained with minimal number of labelled data and more of unlabelled data. The approach tries ti maximize the performance of the ML models with minimal labelled data.
